tec-1 experiments with Antennas

### www notes
- An antenna analyzer is basically a signal generator with a VFO that sends a signal to the attached load and a readout that displays a set of results. Analyzers are generally used by people who are building antennas. It's a tool that helps you physically tune an antenna and check the entire antenna system.
- How do you measure antenna resonance? In common with other measurements for measuring the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit the basic idea is to couple the coil of the meter to the circuit under test. When the meter is tuned to the resonant frequency of the antenna then the meter current will dip.
- Do I need an SWR meter? To tune your antenna, you will need to use a SWR meter. This device is attached between your antenna and radio. This device measures the amount of signal being reflected into your transmitter to help you measure the quality of your outgoing broad cast as well as any potential threat to your radio.
- What does SWR mean? Standing-wave ratio (SWR) is a mathematical expression of the non-uniformity of an electromagnetic field (EM field) on a transmission line such as coaxial cable. Usually, SWR is defined as the ratio of the maximum radio-frequency (RF) voltage to the minimum RF voltage along the line.
- How is antenna power measured? The general approach to antenna tests is to position a known transmitter and antenna at a known distance away from the tested antenna. The tested antenna is connected to a known receiver. The magnitude of the transmitter output is known, as is the loss of any cabling.
- What is meant by peaking circuit? A circuit used to improve the high-frequency response of a broad-band amplifier; in shunt peaking, a small coil is placed in series with the anode load; in series peaking, the coil is placed in series with the grid of the following stage.
- What are peak detectors? A peak detector is a series connection of a diode and a capacitor outputting a DC voltage equal to the peak value of the applied AC signal. 
- Complex voltage and current meters. A second type of antenna analyzer measures the complex voltage across and current into the antenna. Voltage and current in complex form include the following:
```
V = I * Z
I = V / Z
```
where V is the voltage, I is the current, and Z is the impedance.

The operator then uses mathematical methods to calculate complex impedance, is measured, and determine the impedance of a capacitor. Impedance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electric circuit. It is the ratio of the voltage to the current in a circuit. impedance is measured in ohms. The impedance of a capacitor is the ratio of the voltage to the current in the capacitor. The impedance of a capacitor is given by the equation:
```
Z= 1/(jωC)
```
where Z is impedance in ohms, ω is the angular frequency in radians per second, and C is the capacitance in farads. Or reads it off a calibrated meter or a digital display. 

Professional instruments of this type are usually called network analyzers. Modern analyzers do not require the operator to adjust any R and X knobs as with the bridge-type analyzers. Many of these instruments have the ability to automatically sweep the frequency over a wide range and then plot the antenna characteristics on a graphical display. 

Doing this with a manually-operated bridge would be time consuming, requiring one to change the frequency and adjust the knobs at each frequency for a match.
